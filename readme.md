Objective - This project is about generating automatic caption for uploaded image.
Data - This project uses dataset which is downloaded from "https://www.kaggle.com/adityajn105/flickr8k". Flickr 8k dataset contains 8092 images and up to five captions for each image.
Project details - This is end to end project which basically divides challenges into text preprocessing and image preprocessing. glove.6B.50d.txt file has used along with knowledge of text preprocessing and NLP to convert image captions text into trainable matrix. With applied knowledge of image preprocessing and ResNet50 V2 available model, images are converted into other trainable matrices. Then model is trained with use of deep learning techniques where Convolutional neural network (CNN) with Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) is implemented to build the image caption generator which is deployed via Heroku platform with use of flask API.
